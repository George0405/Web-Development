<h2>
    My Experience
</h2> 
<p>
    Since I've started this university course, I have ended up learning alot more about Html and CSS than I already did.
    For my a-levels, I done alot of Html coding but I didnt really know how important it is using CSS with it and this course
    has helped me understand that.<br>
    One of the main things ive learned about HTML and CSS in this course is using a grid structure for muy websites. This has helped
    me format and design my pages much easier, there are many things I still need to learn about the grid layout but i think it's 
    going well so far!
