Community Service<br>
 09/2012 to 09/2014<br>
Voluntary – Northampton, Northamptonshire<br>
Helping at Simon De Senlis Primary School;<br>
When I had teacher training days at my Secondary School, I would help the children at Simon De Senlis primary school at lunchtimes. <br>
This included;<br>

	Playing games with the children aged 5-11 years old, to make their lunchtimes more enjoyable and fun.<br>
	Helping the teachers with any requests.<br>
	Helping the children if they were injured/ hurt.<br>
	Keeping the time schedule tight ensuring all children had only 20 minutes in the dinner hall.<br>

This helped me obtain a better understanding of how teachers do their jobs professionally.
This has improved my Leadership skills and Team Working skills as I have learnt how to work with other people and how to support the members of a team.
I have also gained a sense of maturity and responsibility looking after the children at the school.<br><br>
